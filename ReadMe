Thermal Equilibrium Abundances (TEA), a code to calculate gaseous molecular
abundances under thermochemical equilibrium conditions.

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Earth and
Space Science Fellowship Program, grant NNX12AL83H, held by Jasmina
Blecic, Principal Investigator Joseph Harrington. Project developers
included graduate student Jasmina Blecic and undergraduate M. Oliver
Bowman.

The Install Guide with basic instructions on how to install and run TEA
is: doc/install_guide.txt

For more detailed instructions read the TEA User Guide: doc/TEA-UserGuide.pdf.
For code description read: doc/TEA-CodeDescription.pdf

The TEA Theory paper is submitted to ApJS and will be available in a future revision.
