            =============== Install guide for TEA ==================
                                Version 1.0

This is an installation guide for the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances 
(TEA) code. The code calculates equilibrium abundances of the gaseous molecular
species. It works with high numerical precision, without adjustments, for 
the temperatures above ~600 K. For temperatures below 600 K and mixing 
fractions below 10e-14, the code produces results with low precision. The 
output can be improved with fine adjustments to the lambda exploration 
variables in lambdacorr.py module (see documentation).

   TEA examples with the complete directory structure and files (size ~75MB) 
   are placed in a separate repo, TEA-Examples. A shorter version of the examples is 
   provided within the main TEA repo described above. To download the TEA examples do:
          - git clone https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA-Examples


3. ==== Run pre-pipeline ====

   Files and directory produced by this run are already distributed with the 
          code (lib/gdata, lib/stoich.txt, and lib/conversion_record_sorted.txt),
          thus there is no need to run the code again. However, if new
          JANAF files become available, the user can re-run the code with the
          new data. The code reads only the JANAF tables in the format 
          provided in October 2012.

   To re-run the code with new JANAF tables, create a working directory.
          From 'TEA/lib/' folder, copy TEA.cfg file into your working directory.
          Open TEA.cfg and adjust parameters. Run pre-pipeline as:
    - run ../TEA/prepipe/prepipe.py

   OPTIONAL (run separately):
    - run ../TEA/prepipe/makestoch.py
    - run ../TEA/prepipe/readJANAF.py

   This run will produce data needed for TEA to run, and place them in lib/ directory:
          1. gdata/, directory with thermochemical data
          2. stoich.txt, stoichiometric file carrying stoichiometric values for
             each species in JANAF tables
          3. conversion_record.txt, a record of converted JANAF files required
             for the user to track the species available in the JANAF tables 
             and compare them with the names produced by TEA. This ensures the
             correct pre-atmosphere file is made (see section below).  To sort 
             the content of the conversion_record.txt alphabetically, do:
             sort conversion_record.txt >conversion_record_sorted.txt

   If doprint is set to 'True' in TEA.cfg, the following directory is also created:
          stochcoeff/ - directory containing a file per species with 
                        stoichiometric values for each species

4. ==== Produce input file ====

   If working directory is not made, make one. From 'TEA/lib/' folder, copy 
             TEA.cfg file into your working directory. Open TEA.cfg 
             and adjust parameters. Use gdata/ folder or the 
             conversion_record_sorted.txt to look up the correct names and 
             states of input/output species that TEA can accept.

   For single-TP:
             To create a custom input file, follow the key in the example.
             See example in ../TEA/doc/examples/singleTP/inputs/inp_Example.txt

   For multiple-TP: 
             To create a custom pre-atmosphere file either follow design
             of the example or execute makeatm.py. See example in 
             ../TEA/doc/examples/multiTP/atm_inputs/multiTP.atm

             Procedure to create pre-atmosphere file with makeatm.py:
             a) If working directory is not made, make one. 
             b) From 'TEA/lib/' folder, copy TEA.cfg file into your 
                working directory.
             c) Open TEA.cfg and adjust parameters. Edit both sections. 
                Run makeatm.py as:
                ../TEA/tea/makeatm.py <DIRECTORY_NAME>
                note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that
                      will be made below the current working directory
                Example: ../TEA/tea/makeatm.py multiTP
                The pre-atm file will be placed in the 
                <DIRECTORY_NAME>/atm_inputs/ directory and will have an
                extension as given in TEA.cfg (default:.atm).


5. ==== Execute TEA ====

   If working directory is not made, make one. From 'TEA/lib/' folder, copy 
             TEA.cfg file into your working directory. Open TEA.cfg and adjust
             parameters. Only 'TEA SECTION' is used while TEA is running. Except for
             'maxiter' parameter, all other parameters are for debugging 
             purposes. Setting them to 'False' will ensure the fastest execution.

   For single-TP: 
             In shell from the working directory type:
             ../TEA/tea/runsingle.py <SINGLETP_INPUT_FILE_PATH> <DIRECTORY_NAME>
             note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that
                   will be made below the current working directory
             Example: ../TEA/tea/runsingle.py ../TEA/doc/examples/singleTP/inputs/inp_Example.txt singleTP

             Results will be placed in <DIRECTORY_NAME>/results/
             note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that
                   will be made below the current working directory
             Example: ../TEA/doc/examples/singleTP/results/

             This runs TEA for just one temperature and pressure. The current iteration
             number is printed on-screen as the code progresses. The execution time
             for the example given is 2-5 seconds.

   For multiple-TP: 
             In shell from the working directory type:
             1. If multiTP input file is made with the makeatm.py:
             ../TEA/tea/runatm.py <PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_NAME>/atm_inputs/<MULTITP_INPUT_FILE_PATH> <DIRECTORY_NAME>
             note: <PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_NAME> is the path to the directory, 
                   <DIRECTORY_NAME>, that you have already created when 
                   makeatm.py is run.
             2. If custom made multiTP input file is produced on other location:
             ../TEA/tea/runatm.py <MULTITP_INPUT_FILE_PATH> <DIRECTORY_NAME>
             note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that
                   will be made below the current working directory.
             Example: ../TEA/tea/runatm.py ../TEA/doc/examples/multiTP/atm_inputs/multiTP_Example.atm multiTP

             This will run TEA for every T-P line of the pre-atm file. The current line
             number of the pre-atm file and current iteration number is printed on-screen
             as the code progresses. The execution time for the example given should be 
             between 5-10 minutes on a dual core machine.
    
             Results will be placed in <DIRECTORY_NAME>/results/
             note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that
                   will be made below the current working directory
             Example: ../TEA/doc/examples/multiTP/results/
             The final TEA output will have an extension .tea and will
             have the name of the <DIRECTORY_NAME>.


6.  ==== Output ====

    After running makeatm.py, the following directory and files are created
    below the working directory:

             Output directory based on the user <RESULT_DIR_NAME>.
             Below this directory:

                atm_inputs/ - stores all input files used to run makeatm.py:
                              abundances file - abundances.txt
                              pressure and temperature file - PTprofile.dat
                              TEA config file - TEA.cfg
                              multi TP pre-atmosphere file - pre-atm.atm
    
    After running TEA, the following directories and files are created
    below working directory:

             Output directory based on the user <RESULT_DIR_NAME>.
             Below this directory:

                inputs/    - directory that stores input files used to run TEA
                results/   - directory that contains final results

                            For single-TP:
                                abundances file - abundances.txt
                                TEA config file - TEA.cfg
                                single TP input file - singleTP.txt

                            For multiple-TP:
                                abundances file - abundances.txt
                                TEA config file - TEA.cfg
                                multi TP pre-atmosphere file - pre-atm.txt

                headers/ and outputs/ directories are temporarily made, overwritten
                in each run/iteration and finally deleted after the full TEA run
                is finished.

                If doprint, save_headers, and save_outputs are set to 'True' in
                TEA.cfg, the following are also created:
    
                headers/   - directory that preserves and stores all headers
                outputs/   - directory that stores all intermediate files


7. ==== Plot TEA ====

   To plot the final results, run plotTEA.py. Instructions on how
             to execute the code are found in ../TEA/tea/plotTEA.py documentation.
             Example: ../TEA/tea/plotTEA.py ../TEA/doc/examples/multiTP/results/multiTP_Example.tea CO,CH4,H2O,NH3
             Plots will be placed in ./plots/ directory.

   Recall, for temperatures below 600 K and mixing fractions below 10e-14,
           TEA produces results with low precision.


======================
POTENTIAL USER ERRORS 
======================

1. The user should have unique T-P values for each line in the
   PT-profile file before running makeatm.py, otherwise
   each repeated layer will be overwritten and the final atmosphere
   file will end up with fewer lines.
2. input_elem must have names as they appear in the periodic table.
3. out_species must include all input elements with their states as
   readJANAF.py produces them. See ../TEA/lib/gdata/ folder and the
   conversion_record_sorted.txt file for the correct names of
   the species.
4. Should the code stall on the first iteration of the first
   temperature, check if all elements that appear in the species
   list are included with their correct names.
5. Elemental hydrogen (H) and helium (He) must be included in in_elem
   for hot-Jupiter atmosphere calculations. Similarly, the H_g, He_ref
   and H2_ref species must also appear in out_spec for these calculations.
