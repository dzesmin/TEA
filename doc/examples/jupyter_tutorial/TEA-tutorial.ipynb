    "**TEA** is a numerical **Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances** code, \\\n",
    "that calculates the abundances of gaseous molecular species in thermochemical equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TEA code is available on Github [https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA](https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code applies Gibbs free-energy minimization using an iterative, Lagrangian optimization scheme.\\\n",
    "It uses JANAF thermochemical data and can calculate abundances for 84 elemental species,\\\n",
    "and more than 600 hundred molecular species.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a start guide, user manual, code document in addition to the [TEA published paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0067-0049/225/1/4/pdf).\\\n",
