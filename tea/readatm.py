def readatm(atm_file, spec_mark='#SPECIES', tea_mark='#TEADATA'):
    '''
    This function reads a pre-atm file and returns data that TEA will use.
    It opens a pre-atmosphere file to find markers for species and TEA data,
    retrieves the species list, reads data below the markers, and fills out
    data into corresponding arrays. It also returns number of runs TEA must
    execute for each T-P. The function is used by runatm.py.

    Parameters
    -----------
    atm_file:  ASCII file
               Pre-atm file that contains species, radius, pressure,
               temperature, and elemental abundances data.
    spec_mark: string
               Marker used to locate species data in pre-atm file
               (located in the line immediately preceding the data).
    tea_mark:  string
               Marker used to locate radius, pressure, temperature, and
               elemental abundances data (located in the line immediately
               preceding the data).

    Returns
    -------
    n_runs:    float
               Number of runs TEA will execute for each T-P.
    spec_list: string array
               Array containing names of molecular species.
    radi_arr:  float array
               Array containing radius data.
    pres_arr:  float array
               Array containing pressure data.
    temp_arr:  float array
               Array containing temperature data.
    atom_arr:  string array
               Array containing elemental abundances.
    atom_name: string array
               Array containing elemental symbols.
    marker[0]: integer
               Marks line number in pre-atm file where data start.
