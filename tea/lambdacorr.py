def lambdacorr(it_num, verb, input, info, save_info=None):
    '''
    This module applies lambda correction method (Section 4 in the TEA theory
    document). When input mole numbers are negative, the code corrects them to
    positive values and pass them to the next iteration cycle. The code reads
    the values from the last lagrange output, the information from the header
    file, performs checks, and starts setting basic equations. It defines a
    'smart' range so it can efficiently explore the lambda values from [0,1].
    Half of the range is sampled exponentially, and the other half linearly,
    totalling 150 points. The code retrieves the last lambda value before first
    derivative becomes positive (equation (34) in TEA theory document), and
    corrects negative mole numbers to positive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    it_num: integer
       Iteration number.
    verb: Integer
       Verbosity level (0=mute, 1=quiet, 2=verbose).
    input: List
       A list containing the results/data from the previous
       calculation in lagrange.py or lambdacorr.py:
       the current header directory, current iteration
       number, array of species names, array of initial guess,
       array of non-corrected Lagrange values, and array of
       lambdacorr corrected values.
    info: list
       pressure: atmospheric layer's pressure (bar)
       i: Number of species
       j: Number of elements
       a: Stoichiometric coefficients
       b: Elemental mixing fractions
       g_RT: Species chemical potential
    save_info: List of stuff
       If not None, save info to files.  The list contains:
         [location_out, desc, speclist, temp]

    Returns
    -------
    y: array of floats
       The initial guess of molecular species.
    x_corr:  array of floats
       Final mole numbers of molecular species.
    delta_corr: array of floats
       Array containing change of initial and final mole numbers of
       molecular species for current iteration.
    y_bar: float
       Total initial guess of all molecular species for
       current iteration.
    x_corr_bar: float
       Total sum of the final mole numbers of all molecular species.
    detla_corr_bar: float
       Change in total number of all species.
    verb: Integer
       Verbosity level (0=mute, 1=quiet, 2=verbose).

    Notes
    -----
    The code works without adjustments for the temperatures above ~500 K. 
    For temperatures below 500 K the code produces results with low
    precision, thus it is not recommended to use TEA below 500 K. 
    Setting xtol to 1e-8 and maxinter to 200 is most optimizing. 
    If higher tolerance level is desired (xtol>1e-8), maxium number
    of iterations must be increased. The result can be further improved
    with fine adjustments to the lambda exploration variables 
    'lower' and 'steps' to larger magnitudes 
    (i.e., lower = -100,  steps = 1000). This will lengthen the time 
    of execution.
