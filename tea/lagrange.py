def lagrange(it_num, verb, input, info, save_info=None):
    '''
    This code applies Lagrange's method and calculates minimum based
    on the methodology elaborated in the TEA theory document in
    Section (3).  Equations in this code contain both references and
    an explicitly written definitions.
    The program reads the last iteration's output and data from the
    last header file, creates variables for the Lagrange equations,
    sets up the Lagrange equations, and calculates final x_i mole
    numbers for the current iteration cycle.  Note that the mole
    numbers that result from this function are allowed to be
    negative.  If negatives are returned, lambda correction
    (lambdacorr.py) is necessary.  The final x_i values, as well as
    x_bar, y_bar, delta, and delta_bar are written into machine- and
    human-readable output files. This function is executed by
    iterate.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    it_num:  integer
       Iteration number.
    verb: Integer
       Verbosity level (0=mute, 1=quiet, 2=verbose).
    input:   List
       The input values/data from the previous
       calculation in lagrange.py or lambdacorr.py. It is a list
       containing current header directory, current iteration
       number, array of species names, array of initial guess,
       array of non-corrected Lagrange values, and array of
       lambdacorr corrected values.
    info: List
       pressure: atmospheric layer's pressure (bar)
       i: Number of species
       j: Number of elements
       a: Stoichiometric coefficients
       b: Elemental mixing fractions
       g_RT: Species chemical potential
    save_info: string
       Current directory where TEA is run.

    Returns
    -------
    y: float array
       Input guess of molecular species.
    x: float array
       Final mole numbers of molecular species.
    delta: float array
       Array containing change in initial and final mole numbers of
       molecular species for current iteration.
    y_bar: float
       Array containing total sum of initial guesses of all molecular
       species for current iteration.
    x_bar: float
       Total sum of the final mole numbers of all molecular species.
    delta_bar: float
       Change in total of initial and final mole numbers of molecular
       species.
